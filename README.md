# Dimicandum

## Description
Dimicandum (from latin "you should struggle") is a strategy game. 
It will not only entertain you, but also teach you to plan your future.

In fact, there are two projects: the game itself and the Map Editor for the game. 
You can see doxygen documentation of the projects in proper folders or at the links below.
Map Editor documentation: [html](https://github.com/kostya2709/Dimicandum/blob/master/documentation/Map_Editor/html/index.html), [LaTex](https://github.com/kostya2709/Dimicandum/blob/master/documentation/Map_Editor/latex/files.tex). There will be links to the game documentation later.
